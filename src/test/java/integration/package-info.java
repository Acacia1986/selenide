/**
 * Integration tests for Selenide.
 * 
 * These tests require a real browser and run quite slowly.
 * We typically run them in all basic browsers (firefox, chrome, htmlunit, phantomjs).
 * 
 * They can execute from command line: "./gradle allTests"
 * 
 * They can also be executed for concrete browsers:
 * "./gradle test"  (htmlunit)
 * "./gradle firefox"
 * "./gradle chrome"
 * "./gradle phantomjs"
 * "./gradle ie"
 * "./gradle safari"
 * "./gradle opera"
