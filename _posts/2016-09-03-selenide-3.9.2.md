Good evening!

We released Selenide 3.9.2! 

<br/>
<br/>

## You can download files differently

As you know, we changed a way of downloading files in Selenide 3.9.
We got quite different feedback: some folks reported that new way works for cases where old way didn't work, 
while others reported that the new way doesn't work for cases where the old way worked.


That's why we decided to provide users a choice.


Now you can choose how to download files.


### "New" way - PROXY
This way is enabled by default. 

It downloads files using selenide's own embedded proxy server.

#### Pros:
* This was is better because it's more universal: it not only works with `<a href` elements, but
with any other elements too. Actually it doesn't depend on web elements at all.
It just intercepts all server responses containing files.

#### Cons:
* If you run your own webdriver instance (and add it to Selenide using method `setWebDriver()`), 
it knows nothing about selenide proxy server, which cannot intercept server responses.
We will think how to improve this situation. 

### "Old" way - HTTPGET
If you need to use the "old" way, just add system property `-Dselenide.fileDownload=HTTPGET`.
Or directly in the code:

```java
Configuration.fileDownload = HTTPGET;
```

#### Pros:
* It works independently from selenide proxy server. 

#### Cons:
* It works only with `<a href` elements, and can execute only GET requests.
* It may not work if the machine that runs your tests doesn't have access to a server from which files are downloaded.

Now you don't have excuse not to upgrade to Selenide 3.9.2
