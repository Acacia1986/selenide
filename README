Hello,
this is Selenide project.

--+ What is Selenide?
Selenide is a library for easier using of Selenium WebDriver for automated tests in Java.

---++ What benefits is gives over plain Selenium?

Selenium is not a testing library, it just allows you to manipulate browser. So, combining JUnit and Selenium,
you can write tests like this:

assertTrue(webdriver.findElement(By.id("topic")).isDisplayed());

This is ok for many cases, but in Ajax-rich web applications the element "topic" appears after some time.
Selenide allows testing it:

waitFor(By.tagName("body"), visible);


---++ How to use Selenide?
Tutorial is in progress now, but you can take a look at a example project which already uses Selenide:
https://github.com/asolntsev/hangman-java/blob/master/src/test/java/ee/era/hangman/uitest/HangmanSpec.java

Until tutorial is ready, you can find some Selenide usages there.
